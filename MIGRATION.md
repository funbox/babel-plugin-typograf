# Migration

## 2.1.1 â†’ 3.0.0

We've dropped Node.js 12 support, which means that de jure this plugin does not work with Node.js 12.

However, de facto we have not changed the source code of the plugin in 3.0.0, so it should work with Node.js 12.

Anyway, be sure that you use Node.js 14, 16, or 18. Otherwise test the plugin prior using.
